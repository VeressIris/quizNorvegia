# What is this project?
I built a quiz game about Norway for my geography class. Note that it's in romanian since I made it for class.

Hosted on vercel at https://quiz-norvegia.vercel.app

You add your name, start the game, answer the questions and then see the leaderboard.

# Technologies used:
- SvelteKit
- MongoDB
- Tailwindcss

## Setting up Svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

### Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npx sv create

# create a new project in my-app
npx sv create my-app
```

### Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

### Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.

## Tailwindcss
The instructions for setting up Tailwindcss with Sveltekit can be found here https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/sveltekit
